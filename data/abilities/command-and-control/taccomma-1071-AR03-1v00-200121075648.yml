  name: DNS Regular Beaconing
  description: .      This test simulates an infected host beaconing via DNS queries to a command and control server at regular intervals over time..      This behaviour is typical of implants either in an idle state waiting for instructions or configured to use a low query volume over time to evade threshold based detection..
