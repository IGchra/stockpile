  name: Windows Signed Driver Rootkit Test
  description: .      This test exploits a signed driver to execute code in Kernel..      SHA1 C1D5CF8C43E7679B782630E93F5E6420CA1749A7.      We leverage the work done here..      https.//zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2017/07/puppet-strings-dirty-secret-for-free.html.      The hash of our PoC Exploit is.      SHA1 DD8DA630C00953B6D5182AA66AF999B1E117F441.      This will simulate hiding a process..      It would be wise if you only run this in a test environment.
